# Writing with Generated Text on Mobile Devices
This project was created for my Bachelor Thesis about "Writing with Generated Text on Mobile Devices - An Explorative Study". <br>
It is split into two parts:
- `webapp` is a web application containing two prototypes and a user study for evaluating these prototypes. It uses a Python (+ Flask) backend and a JavaScript (+ React) frontend. 
- `dataeval` is a collection of Python scripts to analyze the data from the study.

More detailed information about the two subprojects you can find in the directories.
