Tue Aug 17 14:51:36 2021;04;1;1;Last Week I was in Greece. On a tour of the country I found myself in an unexpected place and suddenly I felt like a foreign country. It was the first time I've been to Greece, and I'm glad I was able to experience it! It's a very beautiful country. But it was also very hot. So hot, I don't think it was necessary to take my coat off to get out of the heat!;141.76646759999994;17.604621199999997
