143;1;1;For my last vacation i went to croatia with my friends. It was great, i can say that. We went to the beach and had barbeque there. We also went to the best restaurants in town. The restaurant was called Rachael's. The food was so amazing, I was going to go back to eat there again. After we ate there i went back to my room and took my phone. I was sitting there staring at the screen, so i called my friend, who is in town and asked him what he was doing, and if he wanted to meet. He said he would go to the beach with me and see the place for himself. We agreed and headed to the beach. After we saw the place, we went to get some food. After we went to a party. We went to a party, where people were playing games, playing cards, drinking beer, and eating pizza. We saw many people. It was a wonderful vacation.;408.0456704683602;6.894510944839567;11;0;2;2;2;1;2;4
