16:49:30;2172456.42263428; I went back and had a very different experience.
16:49:39;2172465.541498749; When I arrived in Melbourne in October 2010 I was in a
16:49:50;2172476.262056161; very bad mood, really depressed and it's not easy to
16:49:55;2172481.190434338; get out of that mood.
16:50:05;2172491.301840288; It was very hard for me to get out of that mood
16:50:12;2172498.743273831;
16:50:16;2172502.982005809; , so I decided to come back to Australia, because I
16:50:27;2172513.189813277; could live there, but also to get my life back on
16:50:34;2172520.353041515; track.\n\nI
16:50:43;2172529.823563887; thought about going back to my hometown in India and staying there
16:50:54;2172540.069815938; for a while.
16:51:00;2172546.662003073; But that was the first time in my life that I was
16:51:12;2172558.903358808; going to Australia in my life.
16:51:21;2172567.66971411;
16:51:28;2172574.341998074; I felt very isolated and I didn't want to do anything
16:51:39;2172585.62296521; that I didn't feel comfortable doing.\n\nAfter
16:51:47;2172593.077699576; about a month I realised that I had to return to India
16:52:05;2172611.798313594; and start a new life.
16:52:20;2172626.249635533; My parents wanted me to stay and raise my children, so
16:52:45;2172651.153138866; I did that and then I decided to move to Melbourne in
16:52:50;2172656.711054601; September 2012.\n\nWhat
16:52:58;2172664.752932948;
16:53:07;2172673.450547408; was the hardest thing about moving back to Australia?\n\n
16:53:17;2172683.332982629; It's hard because you don't know how people are
16:53:28;2172694.9128905;
16:53:35;2172701.558500413; here.
