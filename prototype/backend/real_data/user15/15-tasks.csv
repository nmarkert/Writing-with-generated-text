152;1;2;I went to Australia. I went back and had a very different experience. When I arrived in Melbourne in October 2010 I was in a very bad mood, really depressed and it's not easy to get out of that mood. It was very hard for me to get out of that mood , so I decided to come back to Australia, because I could live there, but also to get my life back on track.\n\nI thought about going back to my hometown in India and staying there for a while. But that was the first time in my life that I was going to Australia in my life. I felt very isolated and I didn't want to do anything that I didn't feel comfortable doing.\n\nAfter about a month I realised that I had to return to India and start a new life. My parents wanted me to stay and raise my children, so I did that and then I decided to move to Melbourne in September 2012.\n\nWhat was the hardest thing about moving back to Australia?\n\n It's hard because you don't know how people are here.;274.61550461966544;5.568166228476912;27;4;5;4;4;5;4;4
